# info-app
JavaScript assignment for Grit Academy

To run the app, you need to have node.js installed.

Before you run the app the first time, run npm install in the command window. Then run node server.js

The server runs on port 3000. Open localhost:3000 in the browser, and enjoy the info app! :)
