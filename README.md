Weather app with API "Info-App" - group project at JavaScript course (2019)  author: Gosia, Maria, Gabby

https://margareta75.github.io/info-app/

jQuery was used to compare the way of programming with and without it.


To run the app, you need to have node.js installed.

Before you run the app the first time, run npm install in the command window. Then run node server.js

The server runs on port 3000. Open localhost:3000 in the browser, and enjoy the info app! :)


How does the application work?

After selecting the city, it displays information about it, the current weather and the map.

App uses OpenWeather API and OpenStreetMap with Leaflet API.
